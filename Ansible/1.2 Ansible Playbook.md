### In this lab exercise you will use below hosts. Please note down some details about these hosts as given below :



student-node :- This host will act as an Ansible master node where you will create playbooks, inventory, roles etc and you will be running your playbooks from this host itself.


node01 :- This host will act as an Ansible client/remote host where you will setup/install some stuff using Ansible playbooks. Below are the SSH credentials for this host:


User: bob
Password: caleston123


node02 :- This host will also act as an Ansible client/remote host where you will setup/install some stuff using Ansible playbooks. Below are the SSH credentials for this host:


User: bob
Password: caleston123


Note: Please type exit or logout on the terminal or press CTRL + d to log out from a specific node.

### Which of the following formats is the Ansible playbook written in?

Ansible playbooks are written in YAML format.

### How many Ansible plays are there in the following given playbook?



    ---
    - name: Setup apache
      hosts: webserver
      tasks:
        - name: install httpd
          yum:
            name: httpd
            state: installed
        - name: Start service
          service:
            name: httpd
            state: started
    
    - name: Setup tomcat
      hosts: appserver
      tasks:
        - name: install httpd
          yum:
            name: tomcat
            state: installed
        - name: Start service
          service:
            name: tomcat
            state: started




There are two Ansible plays named Setup apache and Setup tomcat in the given playbook.


### How many tasks are there under Setup apache Ansible play?



    ---
    - name: Setup apache
      hosts: webserver
      tasks:
        - name: install httpd
          yum:
            name: httpd
            state: installed
        - name: Start service
          service:
            name: httpd
            state: started
    
    - name: Setup tomcat
      hosts: appserver
      tasks:
        - name: install httpd
          yum:
            name: tomcat
            state: installed
        - name: Start service
          service:
            name: tomcat
            state: started

In the given playbook, there are two tasks named install httpd and Start service under Setup apache Ansible play.

## If we use the following inventory, on which hosts will Ansible install the httpd package using the given playbook?


    [webserver]
    web1
    web2
    [appserver]
    app1
    app2
    app3




    ---
    - name: Setup apache
      hosts: webserver
      tasks:
        - name: install httpd
          yum:
            name: httpd
            state: installed
    
    - name: Setup tomcat
      hosts: appserver
      tasks:
        - name: install httpd
          yum:
            name: tomcat
            state: installed
    

The httpd package is being installed by Setup apache play, which is supposed to run for webserver hosts. As per the given inventory, webserver group contains two hosts, web1 and web2, so the playbook will install httpd package on web1 and web2 hosts.


### Which of the following commands can you use to run an Ansible playbook named install.yaml?


(A) ansible-playbook install.yaml


(B) ansible-playbook run install.yaml


(C) ansible-playbook -p install.yaml


(D) ansible-playbook -i install.yaml


```ansible-playbook install.yaml``` command can be used to run install.yaml playbook.

## A sample playbook named update_service.yml is shown below, it is supposed to update a service on your servers.

    
    - hosts: all
      tasks:
        - name: Install a new package
          apt:
            name: new_package
            state: present
    
        - name: Update the service
          service:
            name: my_service
            state: restarted
    
        - name: Check service status
          service:
            name: my_service
            state: started




Which command would you use to run update_service.yml playbook in check mode?




A. ansible update_service.yml
B. ansible-playbook update_service.yml --check
C. ansible-playbook update_service.yml
D. ansible-playbook --check update_service.yml



To run update_service.yml playbook in check mode, use ```ansible-playbook update_service.yml --check``` command.


### Consider again the same sample playbook named update_service.yml as shown below.

    
    - hosts: all
      tasks:
        - name: Install a new package
          apt:
            name: new_package
            state: present
    
        - name: Update the service
          service:
            name: my_service
            state: restarted
    
        - name: Check service status
          service:
            name: my_service
            state: started




Let's suppose you have already ran this playbook on your server. Now, once you run this playbook in check mode against same server, which tasks would result in changed status?


A. Install a new package
B. Update the service
C. Check service status
D. All of the tasks


In the provided sample playbook update_service.yml, there are three tasks:


A. Install a new package
B. Update the service
C. Check service status


When update_service.yml playbook is already ran on a server and we try to run it again in check mode against same server, Ansible will indicate which tasks would result in changed status.


The task Install a new package would not be marked as changed because it's just ensuring the package is present and that was already installed on the server from earlier execution(s).


The task Update the service would be marked as changed because restarting a service is a change in state.


The task Check service status would not be marked as changed since it's only verifying the service's state, and previous task has already started it.


Therefore, the tasks that would result in changed status is:
Update the service


### There is another sample playbook named configure_database.yml that modifies a configuration file on your database servers. The initial code sample is as follows:


    - hosts: all
      tasks:
        - name: Set max connections
          lineinfile:
            path: /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf
            line: 'max_connections = 500'
    
        - name: Set listen addresses
          lineinfile:
            path: /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf
            line: 'listen_addresses = "*"'
    



Which command would you use to run the configure_database.yml playbook in both check mode and diff mode?

      
      A. ansible-playbook configure_database.yml --diff
      B. ansible-playbook configure_database.yml --check
      C. ansible-playbook configure_database.yml --check --diff
      D. ansible-playbook --diff --check configure_database.yml



To run the configure_database.yml playbook in both check mode and diff mode, use ```ansible-playbook configure_database.yml --check --diff``` command.

----


### Consider again the same sample playbook named configure_database.yml as shown below.

    
    - hosts: all
      tasks:
        - name: Set max connections
          lineinfile:
            path: /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf
            line: 'max_connections = 500'
    
        - name: Set listen addresses
          lineinfile:
            path: /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf
            line: 'listen_addresses = "*"'




To check the configure_database.yml playbook for syntax errors, which command would you use?

    
    A. ansible-playbook configure_database.yml
    B. ansible-playbook configure_database.yml --syntax
    C. ansible-playbook --syntax-check configure_database.yml
    D. ansible configure_database.yml --syntax-check




To check the configure_database.yml playbook for syntax errors, you can use ```ansible-playbook --syntax-check configure_database.yml``` command.

## You've been given a playbook named database_setup.yml that is supposed to set up a PostgreSQL database on your servers. Before deploying it, you want to ensure that it adheres to best practices and doesn't have any style-related issues.


The initial sample playbook is as follows:
    
    - name: Database Setup Playbook
      hosts: db_servers
      tasks:
        - name: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed
          apt:
            name: postgresql
            state: latest
            update_cache: yes
    
        - name: Start PostgreSQL service
          service:
            name: postgresql
            state: started
    
        - copy:
            src: /path/to/pg_hba.conf
            dest: /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf
          notify:
            - Restart PostgreSQL




Which command would you use to run ansible-lint on the database_setup.yml playbook?


    A. ansible database_setup.yml --lint
    B. ansible-lint database_setup.yml
    C. ansible-playbook database_setup.yml --lint
    D. lint-ansible database_setup.yml


To run ansible-lint on the database_setup.yml playbook, use ```ansible-lint database_setup.yml``` command.


----

## Consider again the same sample playbook named database_setup.yml as shown below.


    - name: Database Setup Playbook
      hosts: db_servers
      tasks:
        - name: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed
          apt:
            name: postgresql
            state: latest
            update_cache: yes
    
        - name: Start PostgreSQL service
          service:
            name: postgresql
            state: started
    
        - copy:
            src: /path/to/pg_hba.conf
            dest: /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf
          notify:
            - Restart PostgreSQL




After running ansible-lint on the playbook, which of the following issues might you expect to see?

    
    A. Incorrect indentation.
    B. Deprecated 'apt' module.
    C. Missing 'name' attribute for a task.
    D. Use of a blacklisted command.


After running ansible-lint on the playbook, the following issues might be seen.

    
    A. Incorrect indentation.
    C. Missing name attribute for a task


---

## You've been given feedback from ansible-lint about potential issues in your hypothetical webserver_setup.yml playbook. The feedback mentions issues with indentation, deprecated modules, and missing name attributes.



Which of the following is NOT a recommended action based on the feedback?

    
    A. Correcting the indentation in the playbook.
    B. Replacing deprecated modules with their newer counterparts.
    C. Ignoring the feedback and proceeding with playbook execution.
    D. Adding 'name' attributes to tasks that are missing them.

```Ignoring the feedback and proceeding with playbook execution``` is definitely not a recommended action.


--- 

## If ansible-lint provides no output after checking a playbook, what does it indicate?


    
    A. The playbook has syntax errors.
    B. The playbook is empty.
    C. The playbook adheres to best practices and has no style-related issues.
    D. ansible-lint failed to check the playbook.


If Ansible-lint provides no output after checking a playbook, it indicates that, the playbook adheres to best practices and has no style-related issues.
