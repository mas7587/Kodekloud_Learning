#### Multi-container Pods Design Patterns

There are 3 common patterns, when it comes to designing multi-container PODs. The first and what we just saw with the logging service example is known as a side car pattern. The others are the adapter and the ambassador pattern.

But these fall under the CKAD curriculum and are not required for the CKA exam. So we will be discuss these in more detail in the CKAD course.
